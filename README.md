# EmojiScraper
Simple scraper to get every emoji from Unicode.org

Clone, init and run - give it ~2 minutes, saves to `emoji-data.json` in the folder it was run from

Feel free to use the `emoji-data.json` in the releases, though note it is 68mb and is scraped from v14 (latest as of 11/04/22)

ALL HAIL THE EMOJI MONSTER!
