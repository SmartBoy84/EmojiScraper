# EmojiScraper
### Simple scraper to get every emoji from Unicode.org

Clone, init and run - give it ~2 minutes, saves to `emoji-data.json` in the folder it was run from

**Need to run with `--max-old-space-size=4096` else JS heap runs out of memory** 
<br>
<br>
Feel free to use the `emoji-data.json` in the releases, though note it is 68mb and is scraped from v14 (latest as of 11/04/22)
<br>
Run convert.js to convert data in JSON file to PNG images
ALL HAIL THE EMOJI MONSTER!
